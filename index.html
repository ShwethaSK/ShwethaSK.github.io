<h1>Hey There!!!</h1>
<h2 style='border:3px solid black'>Introduction</h2>
<p>I am <strong>Shwetha </strong><strong>S </strong><strong>Kumar </strong>,a first year Btech student of <strong>Production</strong> <strong>Engineering</strong> in <strong>National</strong><strong> Institute</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Technology</strong>, <strong>Tiruchirappalli</strong>. <a href="http://nitt.edu" title="NITT's official website">(www.nitt.edu) </a>Born in Trivandrum,Kerala and brought up in Kolkata,West Bengal I am pretty much a true Indian-mix of both South Indian and North Indian cultures.My hobbies include <br />1.sketching <br />2. swimming <br />3.collecting postage stamps,antique items,coins,etc..
<hr />
<p>I am an <em><strong>optimistic </strong></em>,<em><strong>dedicated </strong></em>,<em><strong>ambitious </strong></em> and <em><strong>hardworking</strong></em> person who puts her heart and soul into achieving her goals. However, I am a<em><strong> bit reserved</strong></em>, <em><strong>dont generally mix freely</strong></em> and <em><strong>take time to open up to people.</strong></em> A non-vegetarian,Chinese was my favourite cuisine and I anyday preferred junk food like burgers and pizzas over all other food items till college happened and hostel life taught me the importance of home-made food. I do read books in my free time though I am not exactly an avid reader. My favourite author is Paulo Coelho<img src="download1.jpg" height="50"/> and my favourite book is The Alchemist<img src="download2.jpg" height="50"/>. A quote from that book caught my eye then and has stayed with me till now, inspiring me through all walks.

<p>My interest in the field of computers was awakened in class IX when we were taught Java as part of our course in school. However, since I had initially aimed to become a doctor, I opted for Biology in class XI and lost all touch with computer science. Fate had other plans and destiny introduced me to engineering and since I got an opportunity to work with computers once again I decided to pursue my interest in coding and algorithm. Clubs such as Spider, Delta, etc. in our college provide a very good platform for students like me to hone our skills in coding and improve our knowledge. I love science and technology and wish to be always connected with it in some way or the other. I plan to pursue research after college and aim to use my knowledge for the betterment of society and mankind. I am particularly interested in Physics and Computer Science and hope to use my skill and knowledge to serve the nation. 
</p>
Thats pretty much all there is to know about me.

Thank you</h2>
